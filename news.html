                        <h3>Battlefield 5: Firestorm - What You Need to Know About the Battle Royale Mode</h3>
                        <p>1 hour 55 minutes ago - Battlefield V, it’s time for our final overview and verdict. For the full picture, make sure to check out each part.

                                While it’s absolutely a massive and addictive shooter, there’s little question in my mind that Battlefield V launched well before it was ready. Between the brevity and lack of gameplay variety in the single-player campaign, the problems that arise when playing anything other than Conquest on certain maps, and perhaps most troubling of all, the frequent and sometimes game-breaking bugs are all issues that seem like they could be solved with a couple more months of development time.
                                
                                As I said in my review of the centerpiece multiplayer modes, the good news is that Battlefield V’s new design features, like the attrition system which limits health and ammo availability, succeed in enhancing class identity and teamplay. Meanwhile changes to recoil, time to kill, spotting have the effect of making the battlefield a more lethal, and immersive place.
                                
                                Here’s my verdict on the multiplayer modes.

                                The feeling of getting in on the ground floor of something that will inevitably much better mere months from now is unavoidable while playing Battlefield V’s multiplayer. Squadplay and infantry combat, in general, is taken in a very worthwhile direction with smart tweaks to guns and resources, but the same care hasn’t been applied throughout. Rampant bugs, wildly varying mode times in similar playlists, and half-baked features like Combat Roles take their toll. The good news is that patches are already rolling out, and with a year or more of free maps and modes on the way, Battlefield V can only get better from here.

                        <h3>AMERICAN VANDAL: SEASON 1 / 15 SEP 2017 9:27 AM PDT
                                AMERICAN VANDAL: SEASON 1 REVIEW</h3>
                        <p>2 hours 11 minutes ago - ne thing I'm pretty sure we're all hyper-aware of right now is that there's a lot of TV. Too much TV, some could easily argue. You've still got your huge hits like Game of Thrones and The Walking Dead but from there everyone's personal viewing schedules and preferences splinter and vary. Adding to all this is Netflix spending billions so they can launch dozens of new shows, sometimes in a single month, with no hype or push behind them. They just sort of land and it's then up to us to discover them. Stranger Things, back in the summer of 2016, certainly had a unique hook, but there was little-to-no advertising for it beforehand. It just blew up.

                                I don't think American Vandal is going to explode in the same way as Stranger Things, no, but I am here to attempt to, I suppose, sell you on it. To let you know why adding this under-the-radar series to your watch list, over perhaps some other under-the-radar shows, is worth your time. That's not to say that some of you haven't heard about American Vandal already because it's not like it's been totally invisible, but it's certainly not what you'd consider one of Netflix's high profile properties..

                        <h3>Epic Store Boss Says Metro Exodus' Sales Prove It's About the Games, Not the Platform</h3>
                        <p>2 hours 15 minutes ago - After revealing the figures, Steve Allison, head of Epic Games Store, said, "it's really about the games, not the store you sell on," via GamesIndustry.biz.

                                "We're super stoked to see this result, and one thing we can say for certain is Epic Games Store is sure to make many hundreds of millions of dollars for our development partners this year."

                                Metro Exodus was announced as an Epic Store timed exclusive back in January, and the news wasn't well-received, with Valve calling the decision "unfair," especially given the "long pre-sale period."
                                
                                The situation became a bit messy as an increasing number of parties stepped in with their thoughts, and the previous games in the series were review bombed on Steam by disgruntled fans as a result.

                                Epic announced its store in December, 2018, offering developers an 88% revenue share compared to Steam's 70/30 split, making it a much more attractive option.

                        <h3>Xbox One S All-Digital Details Apparently Leaked</h3>
                        <p>3 hours 7 minutes ago - BY JOE SKREBELS Images of the reportedly incoming Xbox One S All-Digital console have apparently been leaked, alongside a mooted launch date of May 7 2019.

                                Rumours about the disc-free console, apparently codenamed Maverick, began last year, with the Xbox One S All-Digital name appearing earlier this month.
                                
                                Windows Central reports that it's received product images of the upcoming console, and has remade them as Photoshop mock-ups. The images apparently show a console that's almost visually identical to the Xbox One S, minus a disc drive and eject button on the front-left.
                                
                                Share
                                Autoplay setting: On
                                The images also apparently show that the console will come with a 1TB hard drive, plus codes for Sea of Thieves, Minecraft and Forza Horizon 3 (yes, not Horizon 4).
                                
                                No pricing has been revealed, but Windows Central reports that it will have the lowest RRP of all Xbox One consoles. It's worth bearing in mind that these are rumours, so much of this information could be changeable.
                                
                                It's not the only Xbox we might see appear this year. Rumours of a family of next-gen consoles abound, and Head of Xbox Phil Spencer has recently told employees that they will "go big" at E3 this year following the Google Stadia reveal at GDC this week.
